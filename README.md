Maletese aim to be a web ui framework based on a view hierarchy (opposed to DOM). It lowers the barrier of front-end web development for people that don't want to bother with HTML/CSS.
It's a super-layer above WebGL that expose simple to use UI components (like buttons, labels, lists, etc.)
[PixiJS](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html) is used as a building block of Maltese as it abstracts the WebGL calls.
